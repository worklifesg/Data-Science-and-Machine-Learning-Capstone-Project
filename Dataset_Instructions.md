# Dataset Instructions

There is a lot of confusion in the course content and how to do your project. You can do through IBM Watson AI by first downloading the data and uploading it on cloud server
or simply download the data and work on your machine (via Jupyter Notebook) as I did in my case.

* Correct Dataset needs to be download:  
  * [NYC 311 Dataset](https://cocl.us/311_NYC_Dataset)
  * [NYC PLUTO Dataset](https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/planning/download/zip/data-maps/open-data/nyc_pluto_18v1.zip)

* The data set is big (2.5 GB and 46 MB)
